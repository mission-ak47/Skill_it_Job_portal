Have you seen rejections with the jobs applied to various companies?  

Have you got no comment or feedback from the HRs?  

Don’t know what technology to learn to stay upgraded in the market?  

If your answer is yes, this project will help you answer many more questions as above and will help you in your career development to reach the right area that you always dreamt about. Many jobs are offered to candidates on a first come first serve basis. The focus is to update job openings regularly that are posted in Fortune 500 companies and to be the first to apply for the respective roles. Industries are working on various domains and gaps in filling the right jobs with the right human posing the right skills. By doing this, we effectively and efficiently reduce the gap and strategically position employees to serve the industry.  

This database will be updated with the job id, job description, posting date, city, and job skills. A user database will initially take one’s skills. By matching the given skills, it notifies the user to apply to exotic top jobs irrespective of domain and by ensuring no gaps in the industry and unemployed individuals.  

This match will ensure and help the user to grow and know the industry’s expectations.   

The Fortune500 Companies Database is created with the links for the job portal. By scraping data from the job portal websites every day, we populate the database with the newly updated company, job id, location, and skills without duplication. Based on the data from the portals, a daily report is generated which would guide the user on the right jobs that the user matches with a percentage on the skill matrix.   

Using data from the Fortune500 website and python, the databases are updated with the jobs. The user is given notifications based on the user database filled and updated. A tracking system is also included where the user can add information about his application and job status giving feedback to systems to capture data on the job profiles and helping the tool to gain knowledge to give out the probability index for each new applicant.   

From the above feedback and user information, the competitive business can know the technologies and the organization strategy and keep track of the individuals working in various organizations to stay abreast in the industry and help collaborative growth.
